# ü§ñ AI Buddy: Your Personal Mind-Mapping Companion

  <!-- We'll make a cool screenshot for this later! -->

**AI Buddy is a web application designed for mental clarity and personal growth, built for the ReverieHacks 2025 hackathon.** It provides a suite of AI-powered tools to help users untangle their thoughts, chat with their "future self," and embark on guided mental simulations.

## ‚ú® Features

Our app is built around three core experiences designed to provide support and clarity:

*   **Future Self Chat:** An interactive chat experience where you can get personalized advice and encouragement from an AI modeled to be your wiser, future self. It uses your chat history to provide context-aware responses.
*   **Thought Unknotter:** A powerful visualization tool. Simply paste your messy, tangled thoughts, and our AI will generate a clean, structured Mermaid flowchart to help you see the connections and find a path forward.
*   **Guided Simulations:** Embark on interactive, narrative-driven mental adventures. These stories, powered by AI, present you with choices that help build resilience, creativity, and problem-solving skills.
